# Binary-Classification
This is the assignment solution for the datascience role of a Company. I have attempted a binary classification problem given the data, and have attempted feature selection, training (with validation) and presented the predictions.

# Methods Used

1.Random 
2.KNN
3.Naive Bayes
4.Logistic Regression
5.DecisionTree
6.Random Forest
7.xgboost

# Technologies
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit learn
- jupyter notebook
- etc.

# Key Steps:
- Used RandomForest Classifier for feature selection.
- Selected top 30 features with respect to their feature importance.
- For metric I have considered Binary CrossEntropy and AUC score.
- The best model I get is Xgboost.
